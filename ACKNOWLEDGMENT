The modified and extended djview viewer with poliqarp client,
made available by the Formal Linguistics Department
of the University of Warsaw, facilitates searching digitalized
texts in the DjVu format. The modification has been implemented
by Grzegorz Chimosz. The ideas to use DjView as a poliqarp
client and others improvements were developed by Janusz S. Bie≈Ñ.
The work on the djview modification is supported
by the Ministry of Science and Higher Education's grant no. N N519 384036.
