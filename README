djview4shapes is a fork of djview4
(http://djvu.sourceforge.net/djview4.html).  Its purpose is to display
the content of common shapes dictionaries contained in DjVu
documents.

The idea to display the common shapes of a document (to facilitate
e.g. transcription and character inventory extraction) and other
suggestions were formulated by Janusz S. Bień. The program is developed by
Michał Rudolf using some code of Grzegorz Chimosz.

The work is supported by the Ministry of Science and Higher
Education's grant no. N N519 384036.
